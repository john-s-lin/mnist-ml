# mnist-ml

## Premise

I wanted to revisit my appreciation for C++ (as my 2nd favourite language after Python) and my interest in machine learning in this project, and found [Gerard Taylor](https://github.com/gtaylor5/mnist_ml)'s MNIST machine learning YouTube tutorial [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL79n_WS-sPHKklEvOLiM1K94oJBsGnz71) to be at once a great review of both the ML concepts and C++ elements that I had learned in university, in COMP-432 [Machine Learning](https://aits.encs.concordia.ca/aits/public/top/courses/20212/05/COMP432.html) and COMP-345 [Advanced C++ Programming](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~paquet/wiki/index.php?title=COMP345_-_fall_2021), respectively.

Moreover, I also wanted to learn Rust and thought that after implementing this project in C++, I would "translate" it to Rust.
